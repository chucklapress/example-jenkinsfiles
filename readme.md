# Example Jenkinsfiles

Jenkinsfile and groovy scripts from my digital oceans droplet

## What to do with these
I have added these to source control as my learning examples  
for various use cases of running robot test jobs or pwsh or saving  
archive files

## Hey some new stuff added  
I have updated the pwsh_pipeline groovy script to add  
some new features like Slack channel notifications, as well as a post stage  
Here is the url to learn more on the Slack plugin
